2. Read about different Data Types in Python.

There are two type of Data Structure in python:

-Primitive Data structure: It is called primitve as they are building blocks for data manipulation and can hold only one type of data.

-Non primitve data structure: Non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure that can store the data of more than one type.

Primitve data structure consist of the following data types:

 * Integer : whole number[int] Integers represent numeric data – they represent whole numbers from negative infinity to infinity. 
 
 * String: collection of alphabet[str] Strings are used to store data that involves characters (e.g., names or addresses). Strings can be created in Python by enclosing a sequence of characters within a pair of single or double-quotes.

 * Boolean: conditional [True/False] Boolean type only has two types of return values: True and False. These return values are interchangeable with the integers 1 and 0.

 * Float: floating point [float] Floating points are used for rational numbers that usually end with a decimal figure.

Non-primitve data structure consist of the following data types:

* List: Python Lists are used to store collections of heterogeneous items; they can be recognized by their square brackets which​ hold elements and are ​separated by a comma.

* Dictionaries: A dictionary is an unordered, changeable, and indexed collection of elements. In Python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets and contain​ keys and values. See the code below:
