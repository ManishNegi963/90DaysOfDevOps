#DevOps?

  DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations with aim of shortening the system development life cycle and providing continuous delivery of high software quality. 



  #Automation?

   Automation is the process of using technologies to perform a task that reduces human intervention.



 #Scaling?

   Scaling refers to increasing or decreasing the resources according to the workload with intention of minimizing the cost.

    There are two types of scaling:

     - Vertical scaling: It refers to increasing the capacity of the server or assigning larger resources.

     - Horizontal scaling: It refers to increasing/decreasing the number of resources.



  #Infrastructure

There are two types of Infrastructure On-premises and cloud.

   - On-premises infrastructure means software and hardware setup deployed and running within the premises of the organization. 

   - Cloud Infrastructure refers to the software and hardware running on a virtual platform like #AWS, #GCP, or Microsoft #Azure.



# Why DevOps is important?

  - DevOps is important as it bridges the gap between development and operation in an organization and aims to improve productivity as a whole. It shortens the life cycle of system development with the continuous delivery of high-quality software.
